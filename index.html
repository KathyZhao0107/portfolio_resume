                            <p>Tools: Python, Excel VBA</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 0.85em">
                                <li><strong>Brief Overview:</strong> For each project, our department creates a material/manpower database from client's price shedule, 
                                    which will serve as the master data to integrate pricing and cashflow. 
                                    The consolidated results from database are linked back to price shedule as the final bid pricing.
                                    I automated this process using Excel VBA and Python scripts, allowing users to easily adjust key parameters through an interactive interface.
                                </li>

                            <p>Tools: Power BI</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 0.85em">
                                <li><strong>Brief Overview:</strong> Designed a detailed manhour and budget planning report that visualizes labor hours and budgets from regional, departmental, and individual perspectives. 
                                    The report also tracks project progress alongside corresponding budget milestones, providing a clear view of both resource allocation and financial performance. 
                                    This allows for better decision-making, efficient resource management, and alignment between project timelines and budget utilization.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Impact:</strong>It enables commercial bid and project managers to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and track budget adherence in real-time. 
                                    This improved visibility can lead to more accurate forecasting, reduced budget overruns, and timely identification of potential delays, 
                                    ultimately increasing overall project efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</li>

                            <p>Tools: Python, Power BI</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 0.85em">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Brief Overview:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Developed a data processing and reporting solution using Python. The component handled data extraction, cleaning, dimension structuring, and metric calculations, ensuring a robust dataset. The cleaned data was then imported into Power BI, where I created a comprehensive and logically coherent report with clear storytelling, enabling effective data-driven decision-making.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The operations department collects data from various channels to evaluate restaurant performance, utilizing feedback from the internal audit team, third-party agencies, and customer reviews. The existing system calculates key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide insights into market performance but relies heavily on manual calculations to identify specific issues in each market. This report addresses the challenges of structuring and standardizing data from diverse sources and establishing data relationships. By creating a logical flow in the report, users can delve deeper into the analysis and quickly pinpoint underlying issues, enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making capabilities.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Impact:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            The implementation of this reporting solution significantly streamlines the data analysis process, reducing the time spent on manual calculations by over 90%.

                                        <li>
                                            This allows the operations team to focus on developing solutions and communication materials for existing issues rather than spending time identifying them. The dashboard can be shared with regional managers and distributors through access management, promoting transparency and facilitating smoother communication between operations and frontline teams. Ultimately, this leads to more informed decision-making and targeted interventions that improve overall restaurant performance and customer satisfaction.

                                <li><strong>Brief Overview:</strong> During the Valentine’s Day promotion for the online channels of our brand, we designed a series of gifting strategies to increase the GMV. 
                                    However, we noticed a high refund rate for shopping credits, which impacted overall sales performance. 
                                    To address this issue, I conducted a comprehensive analysis, including repurchase rates between products, customer service feedback, and competitor strategies. 
                                    By identifying potential issues with the shopping credit thresholds, gifting bundle mismatches, and patterns of SKU combinations, I proposed an optimization plan for shopping credits, effectively reducing the refund rate and enhancing customer satisfaction.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced the refund rate by over 2% through targeted tuning to the gifting strategy and shopping credit thresholds.</li>

                            <p>Tools: Python</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 0.85em">
                                <li><strong>Brief Overview:</strong> This project aimed to predict the success of movies, considering both critical acclaim (measured by IMDb ratings) and financial success (measured by gross earnings). 
                                    Using a dataset of over 3,700 movies from 1916 to 2016, we developed distinct models for predicting critical and financial outcomes. 
                                    Critical success was classified into four categories — Bad, Fair, Good, and Excellent — based on IMDb scores, while financial success was evaluated through gross revenue predictions.
                                    Picked random forest classifier as the optimized model, archieved a 75% overall accuracy in predicting critical success categories.
                                    Key features included movie duration, budget, and social media engagement (Facebook likes of actors and directors). 
                                    However, unbalanced data impacted the accuracy for the “Bad” category. 
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The Random Forest model for critical success highlighted the importance of movie duration and director popularity in achieving high IMDb scores. 
                                    For financial success, models indicated that higher budgets generally correlated with higher gross earnings, though artistic elements such as genre played a critical role in critical acclaim.</li>
